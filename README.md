# Book Connect App

Book Connect is an online platform that allows users to discover and explore a library of books. Users can search for specific books, access detailed information about them, and even customize the visual style of the application. 

## About

This is my capstone project for Interactive Web Apps at  [CodeSpace](https://www.codespace.co.za/), where I had the opportunity to learn and apply web development skills.

## Usage

Book Connect is an easy-to-use application with the following features:

1. Click on the search button to start exploring books. (Please note that the search feature is under development and may not work completely yet.)

2. Use the search options to filter books by author or genre. (As mentioned earlier, the search feature is under development.)

3. Click on a book preview to see its details.

4. Toggle between the day and night themes for a different visual experience.

5. Click the "Show More" button to load additional book previews.

Please keep in mind that some features are still a work in progress, and we appreciate your patience as we continue to improve the application.

## File Structure

The project's file structure is organized as follows:

- `script.js`: The core functionality of the application is implemented in this JavaScript file. It includes functions for searching, displaying book details, and other interactive features.

- `index.html`: This is the main entry point of the web application, where the HTML structure is defined and where the application is loaded.

- `styles.css`: The CSS file used for styling the application and making it visually appealing.
